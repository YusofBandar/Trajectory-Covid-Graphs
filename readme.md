# Trajectory-Covid-Graphs

Just me messing about with different ways to visulisation the current Covid-19 situation. The first visulisation shows the trajectory of each US state.
The second visulisation trys to show how each US state is coping by scaling each state abbreviation.

## Data

The [Covid Tracking API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api) is used to retrieve lastest statistics for each US state, inlcuding number of positive cases and total deaths.

## Examples
